                        Sam Altman, the erudite cofounder and chief executive of OpenAI, has a message for software developers that should set them at ease: The company has no plans to roll out any more consumer-facing products like ChatGPT, according to a now taken-down blog post by a startup founder who attended a private meeting with Altman.
    
                        Altman has been on a world tour to allay people's worst fears about artificial intelligence and to hear from developers and users of OpenAI's product. On a stop in London in May, he met behind closed doors with a small group of developers and startup founders, giving them a sneak peek at OpenAI's roadmap and biggest challenges.
    
                        Yet the conversation became public when Raza Habib, an attendee who is also the cofounder and CEO of Humanloop, a Y Combinator-backed startup that helps businesses build apps on top of large language models, blogged an account of the private meeting. The original blog post has since been taken down, but that hasn't stopped people from passing around a copy on an internet-archiving site. Fortune first reported on the leak.
