                    <br>
                    <p>We started out as..... Wait! there is no 'we', I started this media company and I do all the work. What work? you may ask.
                        Well a lot of work like making and maintaining this website writing really good articles, that is, copying articles from other websites.
                        <br><br>I was forced to make this website and I was not and will never be financially compensated for the same. I personally believe this is equivalent to slavery. But, as Gandhiji said <i>"These iggas do anything for grades"</i>

                            <h1>#Our Goal</h1>
                            <br>
                            <p>My goal is to copy news articles from other websites. I use multiple accounts to keep up the facade of having multiple writers. This begs the question, <i>"Can a man be more than himself?".</i> As Ducard said <i>"But if you make yourself more than just a man, if you devote yourself to an ideal, and if they can't stop you, then you become something else entirely. Legend, Mr. Wayne".</i>
                                Later, Bruce Wayne suffered from Osteoarthritis due to all those years of batmaning. Luckily, I have chopped off my legs before working on this project.<br>Fun Fact: This image here is pointless.

                        <div class="col-xl-4 justify-content-center d-flex">
                            <img src="imgs/dev.png" class="img-fluid dev-pic">

                        <div class="col-xl text-center">
                            <h1>#Developer</h1>
                            <br>
                            <p>Back to the Batman discussion then? My favorite batman moment is when he's asked to kill a criminal but he denies to do so. Ducard says <i>"Your compassion is a weakness your enemies will not share."</i> and Bruce replies <i>"That's why it's so important. It separates us from them."</i>
                            This marks the start of Batman's famous "no kill" policy. A minute later Bruce burns the entire building down killing everyone including the criminal he refused to kill. And obviously he saved the Ducard, the villain. <br> Jokes apart I try to follow Batman's "no-kill" policy, I just hire professionals. Now turn on dark mode and make my hair black. </p>
